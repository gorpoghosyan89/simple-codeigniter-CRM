Open311 Simple CRM
====================

Open311 Simple CRM is a basic open source web application for storing problem
reports and tracking requests. 

Installation
------------

Open311 Simple CRM is written in PHP using the CodeIgniter framework. You
should find it easy to install provided you have access to a webserver and a
database.

The code generally expects to be running under an Apache webserver with a
mySQL database. It may be possible change these things if your system
is different -- see the installation documentation:

__Installation instructions:__ see `documentation/INSTALL.md`


Quickstart
----------

If you're familiar with PHP CodeIgniter (or possibly just PHP!) you might be
able to get things going just by dropping the repository somewhere under your
server root. (In fact, for a super quickstart, set up your webserver so that
`web/` *is* the server root).

The Open311 Simple CRM root page will provide diagnostics even if you've not got the
database running, so try hitting that as soon as you get going.

Remember to see `documentation/INSTALL.md` for details. If the home page seems
OK, try clicking on __Main site__ and logging in as the default out-of-the-box
administrator:

  * username: `admin@example.com`
  * password: `password`

You must to change these values as soon as you're logged in! The root page 
will tell you how (until you've done it).
